## Project Overview

The Library Management System is designed to manage books and members in a library. It allows librarians to add or remove books, register new members, and manage borrowing and returning of books. The system is built using C++ and demonstrates key OOP principles.

## Features

- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Easy navigation through different functionalities.
- **OOP Implementation**: Uses classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Error Handling**: Validates user inputs and handles errors gracefully.
- **Console Enhancements**: Colored text and styled headers improve readability.

## Functionalities
1. Add Book
2. Remove Book
3. List Books
4. Register Member
5. Borrow Book
6. Return Book

## OOP Concepts Implemented

- **Classes and Objects**: `Book`, `User`, `Member`, `Librarian`, `Loan`, `Library`.
- **Inheritance**: `Member` and `Librarian` classes inherit from the `User` base class.
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding the `displayInfo()` method in derived classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Using access specifiers to protect class members.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details from the user.

## Usage

1. **Clone the github repository**
2. **Navigate to the root directory of the project**
3. **Run the library_management.exe file**
